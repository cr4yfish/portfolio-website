-- TODO --


-> DONE
    Task: Add SSL compatibility

    Task: Implement IndexedDB to replace server requests for projects when searching or filtering
        Notice: Firefox incognito doesn't support IndexedDB, so the old system has to be activated as fallback
    Note: I Implemented it using localStorage now, so no need for fallback

    Task: Cache blob images

    Task: Instead of re-rendering all project upon a search, 
    remove all but the results, which should make the search experience much more smooth
